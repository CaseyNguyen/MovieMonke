				The infamous Korean game neolttwigi played by Queen Cheorin (Shin Hye-sun).
				<br /><br />
				Better known as a traditional outdoor game of Korean women and girls that
				is typically enjoyed on traditional holidays, neolttwigi is typically
				enjoyed on traditional holidays such as Korean New Year, Chuseok, and Dano.
				Neolttwigi is similar to seesaw, except that participants stand on each end
				of the Neol and jump, propelling the person opposite into the air.
